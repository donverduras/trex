###Final Project for Compiler Course at ITESM Monterrey, August-December 2012

The project is based on a Raptor-like environment, which has a GUI for developing the algorithms, and runs, without the advantage that Raptors gives us of actually knowing step-by-step our process.

This project is built with:
* **Flex/Bison** *for lexical and syntactical analysis*
* **C++** *for the actual compiler and the virtual machine*
* **Nodejs** *to join the GUI with the compiler and execute it at the virtual machine*
